# Class_imbalance

## Problem Statement
Class imbalance poses a significant challenge in the accurate classification of datasets, often leading to biased model performance favoring majority classes. This project aims to investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification model performance and explore strategies to mitigate its effects. Specifically, the project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, such as resampling and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), in improving the classification accuracy, particularly for minority classes. By addressing these challenges, the project aims to enhance the reliability and robustness of classification models in real-world applications

## Observations
1. Imbalanced Dataset Impact:
- The imbalance in the dataset significantly affects model performance, particularly in terms of recall for the minority class.
- Imbalanced datasets lead to biased model predictions, with lower recall and precision for minority classes compared to majority classes

2. Effectiveness of Resampling Techiques:
- Resampling techniques like SMOTE effectively address class imbalance, resulting in notable improvements in recall for minority classes.
- Models trained on resampled datasets demonstrate enhanced ability to correctly classify minority instances, leading to more balanced performance metrics

3. Algorithm Performance:
- Tree-based ensemble algorithms, such as Random Forest, generally outperform classic machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression on imbalanced datasets.
- Logistic Regression models exhibit significant improvements in recall for minority classes after applying SMOTE, indicating its sensitivity to data imbalance.

4. Impact of Data Preprocessing:
- Applying SMOTE before or after the train-test split yields similar improvements in model performance metrics, indicating the robustness of the technique.
- SMOTE enhances the generalization ability of models by increasing the representation of minority class instances, resulting in more balanced and reliable predictions

5. F1-Score Trade-offs:
- F1-score, being the harmonic mean of precision and recall, effectively balances the trade-off between precision and recall.
- Despite improvements in recall for minority classes after applying SMOTE, there may be trade-offs in precision, particularly for models trained on imbalanced datasets
